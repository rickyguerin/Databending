# Intro to Databending

## What's Databending?
+ Edit one type of file with software not meant for editing that type of file

## Tools For Databending
+ Image editor (I use GIMP)
+ Audio editor (I use Audacity)

## Prepare An Image For Databending
+ If you used multiple layers while creating your image, make sure you merge them before exporting
+ Your image should be exported as an uncompressed format (I use .tiff)
+ Not necessary but I recommended giving your image an alpha channel before exporting
+ If you grayscale your image before databending, your end result will be a little less glitchy/grainy

## Databend Your Image
+ Import your image as raw data
+ I don't recommend "listening" to your image, it will probably sound like nails on a chalkboard
+ Apply effects
+ Do NOT do anything that changes the LENGTH of the audio
+ Do NOT modify the very beginning or end
+ Export as the same file type as your source image
+ Good effects are Noise Removal and Reverb

## Postprocessing
+ You have successfully databent an image
+ Depending on the effects used, your result may be very transparent
+ I layer the result on top of a black background, or sometimes the source image
